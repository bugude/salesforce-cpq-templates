# salesforce-cpq-templates

The Moover Salesforce CPQ data set templates .zip files contain a collection of data set template files. Data sets in the template files give you a great start towards deploying your configure-price-quote (CPQ) reference data for Salesforce CPQ. If you have customized your Salesforce CPQ schema, you might need to modify these data sets to accurately reflect your implementation. 

Prodly created these templates with Moover Winter ‘18 in the Salesforce Winter ‘18 release using Salesforce CPQ with the Salesforce CPQ High Tech Demo data. The following versions of the templates are available, for composite external ID (CEID) and virtual external ID (VEID):
    CEID for Salesforce CPQ Winter '18 version 210.15
    VEID for Salesforce CPQ Winter '18 version  210.15
    CEID for Salesforce CPQ Summer '17 version 210.13
    VEID for Salesforce CPQ Summer '17 version 210.13
For information about other versions, contact support@prodly.co.
Prodly intends to validate future versions as they become available.

To access the data sets, unzip the appropriate set of template files into a directory of your choosing. On the Moover Admin tab in the Prodly Moover app, import the data sets from the template files Importing creates a series of data set records in Prodly Moover to speed up the initial configuration for migration of the reference data in a typical Salesforce CPQ implementation. Refer to the Moover Salesforce CPQ Data Migration Guide at www.prodly.co/resources for extensive details.
