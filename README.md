# salesforce-cpq-templates

The Moover Salesforce CPQ data set templates .zip files contain a collection of data set template files. Data sets in the template files give you a great start towards deploying your configure-price-quote (CPQ) reference data for Salesforce CPQ. If you have customized your Salesforce CPQ schema, you might need to modify these data sets to accurately reflect your implementation. 

Prodly created these templates with Moover Winter '18 in the Salesforce Winter '18 release using Salesforce CPQ with the Salesforce CPQ High Tech Demo data. The following versions of the templates are available, for composite external ID (CEID) and virtual external ID (VEID):
